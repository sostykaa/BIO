<h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
<p> I am Swastika Ghimire. I am currently studying Bachelors in Electronics Communication and Information Engineering from IOE, ERC, Tribhuvan University.
I am from Itahari. I am interested in graphics designing and frontend.
Since i haven't been involved in programming quite often so i want to lean more about programming and graphics design through this WLiT fellowship program. </p>
